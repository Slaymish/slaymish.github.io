# Hello!!!


I am *Hamish* :D

I've always thought to start a blog you had to be a 'writer', and I never saw myself as one, so a blog was never made. Though the more I started to think, ok yes, 'famous' blogs obviously have good writers, but… that's not the point? 

The point in this blog is purely to have a space for me to info dump all the ideas that I think are really amazing and cool, though more than likely, I don't currently have the time or skill to actually implement them. I always found myself getting to a point with my ideas where I'd really flesh them out, the concept behind them, mostly in my head, sometimes using chatgpt or equivalent, and then that all?

So here's my attempt at a new method. Actually trying to take the time to write about stuff that I find interesting, and hopefully during the process of doing that, I am able to take more time to actually think about what I'm trying to get across; at the same time, improve my writing and communication skills (as they are in dire need of improvement)…

So yeah, this is gonna be mainly for myself, though if you found it, cool! I hope this becomes a regular activity for me to do, and this isn't the only thing that I've written. But of course, only time will tell!

See you on the web!

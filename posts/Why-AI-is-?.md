I feel like i'm coming at this from a very defensive angle. Like the person I am talking to is a hypothetical person who is against the concept of 'AI' in it's entirety and as a concept. I have a very high understanding of the persons positions, as to me, they also seem intuitively 'correct'. Though... I disagree.

I couldn't tell you why I disagree I disagree, AHHH I feel I could have some cognitive dissonance right now? I'm tempted to make a pros and cons list of both, and try to steal-man both sides as much as I can. Then, once everything I on the table, we can assign it a moral claim of 'good' or 'bad'. I'd like to be clear that assigning a moral value to something doesn't require any association with governments and policies.

I guess I'll do that, that seems like fun:

**Subject: Artificial Intelligence**

**My possible descriptions:** 
- A system that mimics humans in cognitive tasks they can perform
- A system that takes an input and an turns it into a transformed output
- The automation of human cognitive tasks

- For starters I definite am aware of my bias I have when defining the term AI.

So I turned to the internet to see some common definitions people gave it:

**Wikipedia:**
> the capability of [computational systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") to perform tasks typically associated with [human intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence "Human intelligence"), such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.`
	
	
**Urban Dictionary:**
>Describes a program that partly acts like a human

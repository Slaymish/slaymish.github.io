I watched a video by philosophy tube called [AI is an ethical nightmare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaU6tI2pb3M). She talked about two components of AI that has the potential to harm, the actual prediction, and the application of the prediction. The example she gave that has actually affected her was the 'penis detection machines' at airports (full body X-rays). It attempts to detect anomalies, though becomes an issue for gender nonconforming and trans people, as the operator has to either select male or female before the user entered the machine. It detected penises on woman as anomalous, and make them get checked. This has the negative outcome of potentially getting outed as trans in an uncomfortable situation. She explained this is an example of an AI model **projecting its own view of the world onto its users**. As trans people weren't accounted for during the creation of it, it mishandles them.

Intuitively, coming from a software engineering background, my immediate solution is to 'fix' the AI. For example, for the 'penis detector', just account for trans people in the creation of the model. This would solve this specific issue, though there are more issues which I have no solution to, that are quite inherent to AI as a industry...

# Data 

Data is the primary issue I have with AI. To accurately train a model, usually you need a variety of training and testing data. In some cases, like temperature prediction based on sensor data, this is quite easy and ethical.

The issues come for models like LLM's, Image/Video Generators, and Vision models. These require a substantial variety of data, more than any one company can get from their own sources. This requires companies and individuals who are training one of these models, to find data by other means. A few of the options of data acquisition are:

1. Publicly accessible webpages
2. Private website data
3. Synthetic data

***
## Publicly accessible webpages

- What GPT-3 did

## Private website data

- What google did for their video generator 
- Using youtube videos (is this private?)


## Synthetic data

- Generate near unlimited data
- Generate using an existing model (LLM etc)
	- Pushing issue further down (where does *that* LLM get its data)

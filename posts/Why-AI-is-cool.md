I feel like i'm coming at this from a very defensive angle. Like the person I am talking to is a hypothetical person who is against the concept of 'AI' in it's entiety and as a concept. I have a very high understanding of the persons positions, as to me, they also seem intuitively 'correct'. Though... I disagree.

I couldn't tell you why I disagree I disagree, AHHH I feel I could have some cognitive dissonence right now? I'm tempted to make a pros and cons list of both, and try to stealman both sides as much as I can. Then, once everything I on the table, we can assign it a moral claim of 'good' or 'bad'. I'd like to be clear that assignnig a moral value to something doesn't require any association with governments and policies.

I guess I'll do that, that seems like fun:

**Description: A system that takes an input and an turns it into a transformed output**
**Description: The autoimatoin of human cognitive tasks**
